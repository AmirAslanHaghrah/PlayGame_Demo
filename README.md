# PlayGame_Demo

This poject is a Demo of project which uses FFN, CNN, RNN type of neural networks to learn and play various type of games, the game which I use here to learn is named "Ghost Light" which is published for windows 10 devices.

1st: using UnsupervisedDataExtraction python code or SupervisedDataExtraction code train data for is gather.

2nd: TwoLayerFNN_Unsupervised python code is used for train the model.

3rd: PlayGame by loading the trained model can easily play the game and pass the obstacles.
